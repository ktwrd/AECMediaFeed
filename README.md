Simple-ish .NET 9 WinForms app for viewing live-ish data from the AEC for Elections via the Media Feed.

Hastily put together on the night of the 2025 Australian Federal Election.

### Dependencies
- `FluentFTP`

- `ObjectListView` (specifically `ObjectListView.Repack.NET6Plus`)

## Notes
- Viewing Senate Elections is very buggy atm, and I probably won't fix it anytime soon.
- This is not an all-knowing app. I am not a data scientist, nor an election analyst. If you want accurate information, consult the ABC or a reliable news source.
- The app is currently hard-coded to use the 2025 Federal Election Id (which is `31496`).
  - If you want to look at a different election, change the directory used in the `PullLatestData` method (can be found in `MainForm.cs`).
- This app only supports the live/active FTP server provided by the AEC (`mediafeed.aec.gov.au`), and does not currently support the AEC Media Feed Archives (`mediafeedarchive.aec.gov.au`).
